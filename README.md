# arbit-demo

This repo is inteded to showcase the codebase of a video walkthrough of ARBIT.

For those who watched the video, as an FYI, you cannot clone this repo and replicate the project.

Since the environmment variables (.env file) have not been commited, NextAuth will not work.

In stating the above, if you were to disable NextAuth, you could make a functioning replica.
